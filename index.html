        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I majored in math with a concentration in computer science in college. I knew I liked working with numbers and people, but I didn't know exactly what career path I wanted to go down. After interning at a hedge fund and Morgan Stanley in college, I was thinking of pursuing a career in finance. 
            
            <br><br> Then I met my boss on line at a bagel store in 2019. After finding out he was CEO and founder of an AI startup I began pestering him with too many questions. 
            <br><br> He became a mentor to me and eventually invited me to interview as a machine learning intern. I was about to begin when covid struck. By the time they were ready again for interns, the person who was going to manage me was just about to leave for maternity leave. 
            <br><br> My boss told me I could either wait for her to return, or follow him around and help with whatever he needed as CEO. I fell in love with helping organize and run a business and never left his office. Since then, I’ve helped him and our leadership team through Series A and B raises, a software platform acquisition, executives coming and going, several org charts, and more. 
            <br><br> Now my job is the best of both worlds as I get to lead financial planning & analysis, learning the fundamentals of running a finance department at a startup, while also leading strategic projects across different functions. This wide exposure has taught me a lot.
           <br><br> I've gained exposure to the world and mindsets of VCs and growth equity investors, through pitching side by side with my CEO to over 40 in our Series A/B raises, and through working closely with our growth equity partners ever since our Series A. 
           <br><br> From our investors and Wall St-trained VP of Finance, I've learned how to financially model our business and put together high-quality executive-level decks for our monthly board meetings. I've had the privilege of meeting some amazing successful people through being a Board observer & learning the kinds of things they pay attention to in a business like ours.
            <br><br> I've learned how our sales and marketing teams put together and execute a GTM plan, and how important it is for prospects to (1) know they will get ROI and (2) be set with proper expectations about implementation and product functionality in order for both parties to be successful. 
            <br><br> I've learned how product and software teams can be organized for success, and how important it is to only ship code to customers after it's been battle-tested internally over and over. 
               <br><br> I've learned that the best pure tech doesn't always win - user experience and timing are also essential.
           <br><br> I've learned that for a team to succeed, it's ideal that people try their best to kill their egos. Meetings must be arenas where ideas can go to battle and the best ones emerge victorious. I've also learned that it's essential that execs balance being candid/direct and sensitive/thoughtful in their communications with each other and others.
            <br><br> I’ve seen good, bad, and ugly and learned that growth in a startup is not linear. Beyond teaching me skills in financial modeling, executive presentations, and big-picture thinking, my experiences here have taught me the importance of communicating well, asking the tough (or potentially stupid) questions if necessary, and for teammates to challenge one another. Even more importantly, it has helped me develop a sense of urgency in getting things done thoroughly. 
           <br><br>I like to operate both strategically - taking apart and putting together systems and processes - and tactically, rolling up sleeves and making an impact. My main areas of focus are finance and operations, but I’m really focused on helping the executive team get done whatever needs to get done, and trying to learn as much as I can about all disciplines along the way. I’m a deep generalist by interest. You can see that on my medium blog where I write about startups, mindfulness, AI, Kendrick Lamar, math, and more. 
           <br><br> I like meeting down to Earth but ambitious people with good senses of humor. I especially get along with Mets fans - I believe it's a signal for strong character, given what they put their fans through.
